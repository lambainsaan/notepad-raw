I woke up with a heavy heart after hearing about the attack at Bondi Beach, Sydney. I’ve always loved that city — it felt safe — and learning it was targeted made me ache. Earlier this year we had a similar episode in Pehelgam. Those moments feel personal, but they also point to something wider: the walls we build between people create the conditions for harm.

We separate ourselves for many reasons: history, fear, convenience, politics. Over time those separations harden. When people live in separate worlds, it becomes easier to misunderstand one another, to tell simpler stories about “us” and “them,” and for extreme ideas to take hold. That’s why we must begin reducing those boundaries today.

Borders — physical, social, economic, symbolic — shape what we see and who we trust. Segregated neighbourhoods, homogeneous schools, and exclusive institutions make it easy to ignore other people’s lives. That distance reduces empathy, normalises stereotypes, and erodes the everyday contact that prevents radicalisation and violence.

##  **Concrete steps to begin** 


-  **Teach empathy early:**  Integrate social and moral learning into school curricula: listening exercises, perspective-taking, and guided conversations across difference.
-  **Design everyday contact:**  Encourage mixed housing, deliberately diverse classrooms, and community hubs where people of different backgrounds collaborate.
-  **Narrow extreme inequality:**  Progressive policies that reduce poverty and opportunity gaps also reduce social distance and resentment.
-  **Create civic cooperation:**  Practical projects — community gardens, shared repairs, volunteer programs — produce joint goals and mutual reliance, which build durable trust.
-  **Challenge symbolic borders:**  Identify rituals, rules, or norms that exclude unnecessarily and replace them with inclusive practices.
##  **A hopeful imagination** 


I love John Lennon’s Imagine because it asks a simple question: what if compassion were the default? If enough of us teach, model, and build for connection, the lines between religion, nationality, and wealth will thin. The world will feel more unified, more fair, and safer for everyone.

I hope we all choose generosity over guarding, curiosity over certainty, and proximity over distance. We can build a border‑free society — one neighbour, one conversation, one cooperative project at a time.
