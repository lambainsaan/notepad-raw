New day new framework. I am working on [[building-in-public-md#public/Open Sourcing Governance Open Sourcing Governance|Open Sourcing Governance]]. Given that it is a project will contain data like manifesto, I want it to be SEO compliant. SEO is one of the selling points of Nuxt.

Plus there is markdown CMS extension for Nuxt called [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/). Nuxt content can help a person write documentation using markdown. I can then convert that markdown into a beautiful page.

And so Nuxt + Nuxt Content it is. You can read more about the benefits of Nuxt [here](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction).
