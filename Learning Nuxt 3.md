title: Learning Nuxt 3
---
I'm currently working on [[building-in-public-md#public/Open Sourcing Governance Open Sourcing Governance|Open Sourcing Governance]] a project that will include documents like a manifesto. I want to make sure it's easy for search engines to find, which is a feature of Nuxt.

Additionally, there's a helpful tool for Nuxt called [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/) that allows people to write documents using Markdown. Then, I can turn those Markdown documents into attractive web pages.

So, I've decided to use Nuxt along with Nuxt Content for this project. If you want to learn more about Nuxt and its benefits, you can check it out [here](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction).
