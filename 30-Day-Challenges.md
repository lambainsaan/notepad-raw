Hi there, back in the day. I used to take 30 day challenges and it has been a while since I've taken one. Life has been pretty monotonous these days, and I remember how exciting life used to be when I used to take these challenges.

Idea is simple, add something that you wanted to add in your life, and subtract something that you want to get rid of from your life.
