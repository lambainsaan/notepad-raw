Hi there, back in the day. I used to take 30 day challenges and it has been a while since I've taken one. Life has been pretty monotonous these days, and I remember how exciting life used to be when I used to take these challenges. And so time to bring it back into the life! 🙂

Idea is simple, add something that you wanted to add in your life, and subtract something that you want to get rid of from your life.
