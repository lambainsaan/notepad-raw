I have this wild idea, which I sleep on every night.

What if the governance flows from bottom to top?

What if we provide the citizens of India a platform so that their voice is heard?

What if we increase accountability of public servers?

And what if we fight the elections on the basis of development agenda, make it very open as to what the action plan is ahead of time, and publicize it?

The sad part of reality as it stands today, I don't support any political party, or any person in Indian politics. I am not blind anti-this or anti-that, I appreciate the good things that anyone does, and condemn the bad ones. Be it party x or y. But there is no one political party with which I am able to incline on the political agenda. All the political parties are running on religion, caste. I thought Aam Aadmi Party is going to be the revolution that I was looking for, but that party as well became muddled into corruption, religion.

I want to build a cult of people who want to step by step build India, remove corruption, remove differences, build harmony, build trust. Instead of divisive political agenda, I want a party with a developmental political agenda.

We will build this road for you.

Instead of,

We will build this religious institution for you.


We will bring accountability by increasing the scope of RTI.

Instead of,
We are well intentioned people we don't get into corruption.


We will create ranking system for contractors, so that the bad quality contractors are heavily punished, and not awarded a contract.

Instead of,
Chalta hai, system works as is.


We will listen to you.

Instead of,
Who are you to tell me what to do?


We will hold press conference regularly.

Instead of,
*silence and save face*

This is a big dream project of mine. I want to revolutionize the country, and I have good intentions to do so. It is all one step at a time.
