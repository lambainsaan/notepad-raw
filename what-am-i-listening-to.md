| [Health & Longevity](https://app.wakingup.com/life/conversations/COCE1CB) - Behind paywall [[My Subscriptions#Waking Up]]    | 17th August 2023 | #health #meditation #exercise                 | Talks at length about how to have great health, with increased life span. We all might have come across one or the other post claiming this is good food, that is bad food. At times these claims contradicting each other. This conversation is around diet, exercise, hearth health, cancer, meds. Lays out the content in form of what is substantiated with proof and so is a truth, what is still an open question but looks like a truth.                                                           | [Home - Peter Attia](https://peterattiamd.com/)  <br>[Peter Attia (@peterattiamd) • Instagram photos and videos](https://www.instagram.com/peterattiamd/)  <br>[Peter Attia / X](https://twitter.com/PeterAttiaMD) |

By going deep into the conversations, ask straight questions. Goes into how to better implement feedback cycles in organizations. Prepare yourself before going into it. And while you are preparing yourself think from other person's perspective, Dave calls it <u>role playing</u>. Involve people from bottom to top, if you let the top level speak first, the junior people will speak in a way so that it conforms to the senior people. | [Dave Dodson's Twitter](https://twitter.com/davedodson307)                                                                                                                                                 |
