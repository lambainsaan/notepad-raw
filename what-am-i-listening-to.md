| [Ep. 98, Give It to Me Straight: The Power of Honest, Constructive Feedback - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yOsZVgj_FE) | 25th July 2023 | #Interviewing #Leadership #Feedbacks          | Starts with talking about how to better take interviews. By going deep into the conversations, ask straight questions. Goes into how to better implement feedback cycles in organizations. Prepare yourself before going into it. And while you are preparing yourself think from other person's perspective, Dave calls it <u>role playing</u>. Involve people from bottom to top, if you let the top level speak first, the junior people will speak in a way so that it conforms to the senior people. | [Dave Dodson's Twitter](https://twitter.com/davedodson307) |
