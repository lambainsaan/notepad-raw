## Vault

This vault contains my private as well as public notes. This is not public for obvious reasons. ðŸ˜¬

## Notepad Raw

The repository that holds the public notes that I want to share with the world.

Notes are pushed into Notepad Raw after any changes in the public directory in my vault.

## Notepad

The hugo code which hosts [lambainsaan.github.io](https://lambainsaan.github.io). Everytime there is a change in Notepad Raw the public data directory is pushed into the Notepad repo via github action.
