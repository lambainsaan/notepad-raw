AKA Tracking Down Baddies 👀

This is a monitoring tool to track down bad actors in a community.

# What is it?


I see a lot of garbage out on the street, the person who throws it is a bad actor. I can’t blame the governance authorities of the area, they can’t keep an eye out everyone. We need an automated platform to detect people who do that.

# How I will do it?


In a very simplistic view. The idea is fairly simple, take in the video stream. Pass it on to a video models to understand the intent in the video feed. Whenever a bad action happens, figure out the actor and notify the listeners about the bad act.

# What are you thinking of building?


## First phase


A platform where you can spot bad actors based on their behaviours. By integrating external models. Keep it focused on a few majorly occurring bad acts. Offer it as a SaaS product, and make it open source. ❤️


The implementations and plannings of other phases will be based on the success of the first phase. 🙂
