## 1Password: Safeguarding Your Online Security

Are you still using the same password for every online account? Let me tell you, my friend, it's a risky game. If a breach occurs on one site, it could lead to your accounts on other websites being compromised.

I used to be guilty of this myself until I stumbled upon [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/), which revealed the extent of breaches my email had been involved in. That wake-up call prompted me to start using a password manager.

A few years later, I received a spam email containing an old breached password, with an attempt to blackmail me for bitcoins. Luckily, I had already moved on from that password by then. ðŸ™ƒ

The integrations offered by 1Password are fantastic! With a developer API to connect and retrieve secrets from the password store, it's a convenient solution. Plus, there's no need to set up something like [Vault by HashiCorp](https://www.vaultproject.io/) for basic security needs.

### Alternatives to Consider:

- **LastPass**: While I used it when it was free, recent breaches have made me wary. Also its integrations don't match up to 1Password's.

- **Apple's Keychain**: Good if you're deep in the Apple ecosystem, but lacking in features like an authenticator and seamless browser integrations. Plus, it's technically "free" (if you don't count the premium you're paying for Apple devices). ðŸ¤«


## Waking Up: Nurturing Your Mindfulness

Picture this: It's evening in Gurgaon, the sun is setting, and I'm asking Alexa to play the latest episode of [The Tim Ferris Show](https://chatgpt.com/c/a7230c55-d57b-4cd6-9801-92ce1f036b3a). To my delight, Sam Harris, founder of Waking Up, is a guest. He shares insights into the meditations offered in the app Waking Up, and they're truly enlightening.

I didn't immediately subscribe to Waking Up. Being my usual self, I tried to fix things only after they became a problem. Months later, as I was struggling mentally I finally decided to give the app a tryâ€”and I'm so glad I did.

Being a few months into the journey of using Waking Up! It is one of the best application I have subscribed to. Whenever I use waking up, my entire day ends up going in a positive direction. A lot of other meditation apps takes a focus approach to meditation where they present meditation as a tool for focusing. Waking up doesn't try to do that, it is more contemplative, it tries to connect you with the present with non-duality. It makes you feel love, not just for others and your enimies but for yourself as well using metta techniques. It has got amazing conversations around procastination, goal setting, finance planning and a lot of other self help things. 


Waking Up divides its content into three parts: Theory, Practice, and Life. It's a comprehensive resource for caring for our minds.

I invite you to join me on Waking Up's journey.
