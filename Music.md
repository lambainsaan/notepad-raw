I listen to music day in and out.


## Anthems

The music that I start my day with.

### Story behind each anthem

- **Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger** — _Daft Punk_
  - Simple, powerful lyrics. A morning centering track that pumps energy and focus.

- **Jogi** — _Panjabi MC_
  - High-energy Punjabi beats with hype vocals — my go-to energy booster.

- **Jiggle Jiggle** — _Louis Theroux_
  - A fun, moral rap I enjoy; I like Louis Theroux and the playful vibe of this one.
  - Louis explains the song here:

- **Imagine** — _John Lennon_
  - My all-time favourite. Inspires imagining a world without the divides that separate us.

- **The Banjo Beat** — _Hayasa G_
  - An uplifting track that adds extra energy to the morning.

- **Stronger** — _Kanye West_
  - Reminds me of Daft Punk's anthem — I come for the beat more than the rap.

- **Still D.R.E.** — _Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg_
  - A classic with a driving beat that's often played at shows — great for momentum.

- **I've Grown** — _Sofasound_
  - A slower, softer song I use to come down gently after the high-energy tracks.
