I listen to music day in and out.


## Anthems

The music that I start my day with.

  <summary>Story behind each song in the playlist</summary>
  
  **Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger**
-_Daft Punk_

Simple, powerful lyrics. Helps me center in the morning. Focus on working harder. Better the day before, quickly churning out more and more work, and following all these will make me strong. This song just pumps up energy in me.


**Jogi**
-_Panjabi MC_

Most energetic song I have heard. There are people hyping in the background + Punjabi beats, abs perfect song. Again, a pumper for energy.

  - **Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger** — _Daft Punk_
    - Simple, powerful lyrics. A morning centering track that pumps energy and focus.

  - **Jogi** — _Panjabi MC_
    - High-energy Punjabi beats with hype vocals — my go-to energy booster.

  - **Jiggle Jiggle** — _Louis Theroux_
    - A fun, moral rap I enjoy; I like Louis Theroux and the playful vibe of this one.
    - Louis explains the song here:

  - **Imagine** — _John Lennon_
    - My all-time favourite. Inspires imagining a world without the divides that separate us.

  - **The Banjo Beat** — _Hayasa G_
    - An uplifting track that adds extra energy to the morning.

  - **Stronger** — _Kanye West_
    - Reminds me of Daft Punk's anthem — I come for the beat more than the rap.

  - **Still D.R.E.** — _Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg_
    - A classic with a driving beat that's often played at shows — great for momentum.

  - **I've Grown** — _Sofasound_
    - A slower, softer song I use to come down gently after the high-energy tracks.
