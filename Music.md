I listen to music day in and out.

## Anthems


The music that I start my day with.

### Story behind each anthem


-  **Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger**  —  *Daft Punk* 
    - Simple, powerful lyrics. A morning centering track that pumps energy and focus.

-  **Jogi**  —  *Panjabi MC* 
    - High-energy Punjabi beats with hype vocals — my go-to energy booster.

-  **Jiggle Jiggle**  —  *Louis Theroux* 
    - A fun, moral rap I enjoy; I like Louis Theroux and the playful vibe of this one.

-  **Imagine**  —  *John Lennon* 
    - My all-time favourite. Inspires imagining a world without the divides that separate us.

-  **The Banjo Beat**  —  *Hayasa G* 
    - An uplifting track that adds extra energy to the morning.

-  **Stronger**  —  *Kanye West* 
    - Reminds me of Daft Punk's anthem — I come for the beat more than the rap.

-  **Still D.R.E.**  —  *Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg* 
    - A classic with a driving beat that's often played at shows — great for momentum.

-  **I've Grown**  —  *Sofasound* 
    - A slower, softer song I use to come down gently after the high-energy tracks.
