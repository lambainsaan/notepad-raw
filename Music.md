I listen to music day in and out.


## Anthems

The music that I start my day with.

  <summary>Story behind each song in the playlist</summary>
  
  **Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger**
-_Daft Punk_

Simple, powerful lyrics. Helps me center in the morning. Focus on working harder. Better the day before, quickly churning out more and more work, and following all these will make me strong. This song just pumps up energy in me.

**Jiggle Jiggle**
-_Louis Theroux_

I love Louis Theroux. Plus I like this song. This is where I am in my journey right now. My money jiggle jiggle at the moment, but I would like for it to wiggle wiggle. It is a rap but a moral one, you don't come across such songs daily. The way Louis denied using the word bit*h in the song, speaks a lot to me about him. I like him and the song. Here is Louis explaining the song,

**Imagine**
-_John Lennon_

Imagine is my all time favourite. Human civilisation has created divide between each other using boundaries, religions, what if these constructs didn't exist. This song opens up my imaginative thinking, and make me a better human. One unified planet, no difference between one human to the other. üíï

**The Banjo Beat**
-_Hayasa G_

A song which pumps up more energy into me. I need energy boosters at the start of the day, so that I can keep on going through the day. This is one of them.

**Stronger**
-_Kanye West_

More like a remix version of my first anthem, Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger. I like the beats. I just like the sound of this song. I don't really care much about the rap part by Ye.

**Still D.R.E**
-_Snoop Dogg_

This is a classic song played in a lot of EDM concerts, this song just brings more energy as I like the beat. Rap is not as per my taste, it is just the music that I love.


**I've Grown**
-_Sofasound_

This is a slow song, the only one, just after pumping up so much energy into my mind, I like to bring it down a notch so that I can sustain the booster I got from the other songs preceding this one. It is a nice soft song. Again I don't know the lyrics of this one. I listen this just for the music.
